# i3WM Configuration
This is a configuration for i3 WM.

I use i3altlayout <https://github.com/deadc0de6/i3altlayout> to obtain a golden ratio windows arrangement.

!NOTE! Use https://github.com/deadc0de6/i3altlayout/releases/tag/v1.0 - 1.1.2 version not working correctly.

I also added two hotkeys to switch between next and previous workspace.

I disabled bottom status bar and i added an applet for workspace in Mate Panels.

## Fonts
Iosevka is the primary font I used in this config file.
